# About

`GitKraken Pro` it is project to make GitKraken great again. We love this program, but it does not work the way we want. Also we support various Linux distributions.

# GitKraken Pro

`gitkraken-pro.sh` it is linux invariant (neutral) script to apply several patches via `GitCracken aka Patcher` and rebuild GitKraken with latest electron version for your platform.

# I love Arch Linux and I use it

`Arch Linux` it is main platform to support. Just download latest release, extract archive, open your favorite terminal in directory with `PKGBUILD` and type `makepkg -ifs`. Wait... and enjoy!

You can say: "Why I can't find this wonderful script in AUR?". `GitKraken-Pro` was deleted from AUR.

# I love Arch Way and I use Manjaro

See instruction for `Arch Linux`

# GitCracken aka Patcher

`GitCracken` ([was deleted](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2017/2017-02-28-GitKraken.md) from GitHub, but the development continues in private repo :smile:) is auto patcher and non-commercial utils for GitKraken. You can use it standalone on your `Linux`, `Windows` or `macOS`. You can find link to the latest version in releases. Download text file and decode it by `base64`. You should get `*.tar.xz` archive. Extract it. Install it globally `npm i -g`. Type `gitcracken -h` to get more usage information.
